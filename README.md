CupRush is a point-of-sale system made with Python to help cafés run more smoothly. It has an easy-to-use menu with sections for Hot Coffee, Iced Coffee, and Bakery items like donuts, sandwiches, pastries, and cakes. Customers can also customize their orders by adding things like syrups, whipped cream, extra espresso shots, or tapioca pearls.

The system automatically calculates prices, including 12% VAT, and can apply discounts for senior citizens or people with disabilities. It also keeps track of stock levels in real-time, so café staff know when items run low and can restock quickly.

CupRush prints clear receipts showing all the order details, including VAT, discounts, and whether the order is for Dine-In or Take Out. It guides users through each step to avoid mistakes and make the process faster.

Whether it’s the morning coffee rush or an afternoon snack time, CupRush helps cafés serve customers quickly and correctly.
